This project is a POC to understand the potential of Open Liberty.
The code is based on the Open Liberty lead projects, published here: https://github.com/OpenLiberty

== Summary

This POC provides a reliable way to handle messages in reactive applications. It ensures that messages aren't lost by requiring that messages that were delivered to the target server are acknowledged
after they are processed. Every message that gets sent out must be acknowledged. This way, any messages that were delivered
to the target service but not processed, for example, due to a system failure, can be identified and sent again. Some events are stored persistently on a database. This data can be recovered at any time.

The application consists of two microservices, `system` and `inventory`. Every 15 seconds, the `system`
microservice calculates and publishes events that contain its current average system load. The `inventory` microservice
subscribes to that information so that it can keep an updated list of all the systems and their current system loads.
You can get the current inventory of systems by accessing the `/systems` REST endpoint.

The application permit to subscribe a PUT request response. This PUT request response accepts a
specific system property in the request body, queries that system property on the system microservice, and provides the response.
The system handle receiving and sending events that are produced by the new endpoint. It also manages the saving of database data.

It is possible to observe the acknowledgment strategies that are available, in particular, in this POC the
 manual acknowledgment strategy is implemented.

== Prerequisites

You need to have Docker installed. For installation instructions, refer to the official
https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker documentation^]. You will build and run the microservices in Docker containers.
An installation of Apache Kafka is provided in another Docker container.

== Building and running the application

Build the `system` and `inventory` microservices using Maven and then run them in Docker containers.

Start your Docker environment. Dockerfiles are provided for you to use.

To build the application, run the Maven `install` and `package` goals from the command-line session in the main directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl models install
mvn package
```

Run the following commands to containerize the microservices:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
docker build -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT inventory/.
```

Next, use the provided script to start the application in Docker containers. The script creates a network for the
containers to communicate with each other. It also creates containers for Postgres, Kafka, Zookeeper, and the microservices
in the project.

--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/startContainers.sh
```
--

== Testing the application

The application might take some time to become available. After the application is up and running, 
you can access it by making a GET request to the `/systems` endpoint of the `inventory` service.

// Static guide instruction
ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Visit the http://localhost:9085/health[^] URL to confirm that the `inventory` microservice is up and running.

When both the liveness and readiness health checks are up, go to the http://localhost:9085/inventory/systems[^] URL to access the `inventory` microservice. 
Look for the CPU `systemLoad` property for all the systems:
endif::[]

// Cloud hosted guide instruction
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Run the following curl command to confirm that the **inventory** microservice is up and running.
```
curl -s http://localhost:9085/health | jq
```
{: codeblock}

When both the liveness and readiness health checks are up, run the following curl command to access the **inventory** microservice:
```
curl -s http://localhost:9085/inventory/systems | jq
```
{: codeblock}

Look for the CPU **systemLoad** property for all the systems:
endif::[]

[source, role='no_copy']

{
   "hostname":"30bec2b63a96",
   "systemLoad":1.44
}
----

The `system` service sends messages to the `inventory` service every 15 seconds. The `inventory` service processes and
acknowledges each incoming message, ensuring that no `system` message is lost.

Make a `PUT` request to the `\http://localhost:9085/inventory/data` URL to add the value of a particular system property
to the set of existing properties.

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
If `curl` is unavailable on your computer, use another client such as https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman^],
which allows requests to be made with a graphical interface.
--

For example, run the following `curl` command:
--
[role=command]
```
curl -X PUT -d "os.name" http://localhost:9085/inventory/data --header "Content-Type:text/plain"
```
--

In this example, the `PUT` request with the `os.name` system property in the request body on the
`\http://localhost:9085/inventory/data` URL adds the `os.name` system property for your system. 
The `inventory` service sends a message that contains the requested system property to the `system` service. 
The `inventory` service then waits until the message is acknowledged before it sends a response back.

You see the following output:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
Request successful for the os.name property
----

The previous example response is confirmation that the sent request message was acknowledged.

// Static guide instruction
ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Revisit the http://localhost:9085/inventory/systems[^] URL and see the `os.name` system property value is now
included with the previous values:
endif::[]

// Cloud hosted guide instruction
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Run the following curl command again:
```
curl -s http://localhost:9085/inventory/systems | jq
```
{: codeblock}

The **os.name** system property value is now included with the previous values:
endif::[]

[source, role='no_copy']
----
{
   "hostname":"30bec2b63a96",
   "os.name":"Linux",
   "systemLoad":1.44
}
----

When the message is sent from the Inventory, a record is written to the database, with the message id, the required system property
and the send message flag. Then the message is read by the System, which sends the response to the Inventory, which updates the record
in the database by inserting the property value and the read flag.

[source, role='no_copy']
----
[
    {
        "hostname": "96741a5c97ec",
        "id": 2,
        "property": "os.name",
        "readed": true,
        "sended": true,
        "value": "Linux"
    },
    {
        "hostname": "6388d6e2d8b3",
        "id": 54,
        "property": "os.version",
        "readed": true,
        "sended": true,
        "value": "5.4.72-microsoft-standard-WSL2"
    },
    {
        "id": 152,
        "property": "java.class.path",
        "readed": false,
        "sended": true
    }
]
----

== Tearing down the environment

Finally, run the following script to stop the application:

[role='command']
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
